Once upon a time in the forest there was a monkey who resided in a Jamun tree. It was on the banks of the river. 
In the same forest was a crocodile and his wife. 
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The monkey offered him some fruits and they became friends as he loved the fruits.
And I don't know what to write so the end.
